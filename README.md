**Details**

I created this for my own educational purposes as well as using it for training others in the classroom.

It is a series of small demos. Each shows one design pattern.

Enjoy!

**Patterns**

* **Creational Patterns** - Design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern">Wikipedia</a> for more.
* **Structural Patterns** - Design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern">Wikipedia</a> for more.
* **Behavioral Patterns** - Design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern">Wikipedia</a> for more.

**Features**

* **Editor Scripting** - Unity lets you extend the editor with your own custom inspectors and Editor Windows and you can define how properties are displayed in the inspector with custom Property Drawers. See <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExtendingTheEditor.html">Unity Docs</a> for more.

**Principles**

* **SOLID** - The intention of these SOLID principles is to make software designs more understandable, easier to maintain and easier to extend. As a software engineer, these 5 principles are essential to know!See <a href="https://itnext.io/solid-principles-explanation-and-examples-715b975dcad4">Unity Docs</a> for more.

**Tooling**

* **Unit Testing** - Software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. See <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html">Unity Docs</a> for more.
